        <article> my story :  Ashoka was a powerful Mauryan emperor who became a pivotal figure in the history of Buddhism after the brutal Kalinga War, which sparked his conversion to the religion and his subsequent rule based on peace and compassion. Before this, Ashoka was a ruthless conqueror who fought to expand his vast empire across almost the entire Indian subcontinent. After the war, he renounced violence, dedicated himself to spreading Buddhism, and promoted welfare through his famous rock and pillar edicts, leaving a legacy of compassion and tolerance that influences India today.
